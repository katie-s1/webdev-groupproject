                                exploration and learning new things. A fun fact about me is that I'm moving to Taiwan in

                                create my own website. Outside of work and learning, you can find me exploring new
                                places and cultures. I also enjoy learning Mandarin, participating in exercise classes
                                like barre, reformer pilates, and trampoline workouts, and indulging in good food.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">Hello, I'm Rebecca! I am originally from the beautiful lake district
                                but currently live in Leicester with my two lovely cats, Cosmo and Tokyo. Born on May
                                2nd, I'm a Taurus, known for my persistence and dedication.</p>
                            <p class="card-text">With an academic background in Psychology, I stumbled into the world of
                                digital marketing and quickly discovered a passion for it. I’ve enjoyed learning about
                                this dynamic field, embracing its challenges, and contributing to the success of various
                                websites. I am excited to delve deeper into coding to better comprehend the digital
                                landscape and express my creativity in exciting, new ways!</p>
                            <p class="card-text">Outside of work, you'll often find me lost in the pages of a good book,
                                playing video games, or watching horror films. For me, true happiness lies in the
                                company of loved ones, whether it's dressing up for a night out, discovering new food
                                spots, or cosying up for a board game night in. I also love spending time in nature and
                                have a particular passion for wild swimming!</p>

                            <p class="card-text">My name is Ulrika, and I’m originally from Lithuania. I’ve been living
                                in the UK for the past eight years and currently reside in the beautiful city of
                                Edinburgh, Scotland. Although it’s quite cold here, the stunning scenery more than makes
                                up for it.</p>
                            <p class="card-text">I have a passion for traveling and have explored 24 countries so far.
                                In addition to my
                                love for travel, I enjoy visiting art galleries and painting. I also have a talent for
                                designing and making clothes, which complements my professional experience in the
                                fashion industry.</p>
                            <p class="card-text"> Professionally, I am currently a visual merchandiser, where I apply my
                                creativity and
                                eye for detail to enhance the shopping experience and drive sales. My role involves not
                                only creating visually appealing displays but also understanding market trends and
                                consumer behaviour.</p>
                            <p class="card-text"> In my free time, I enjoy football and ice skating, exploring the
                                outdoors, reading,
                                savouring coffee, watching sunrises, taking long walks on the beach, and of course,
                                fashion.</p>
                            <p class="card-text"> I am eager to expand my technical skills with this coding course to
                                further my career in
                                the fashion industry.</p>
